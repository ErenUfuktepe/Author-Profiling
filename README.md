# Author-Profiling

The project is about profiling gender of author. To more precise, I try to predict the gender of an author using his/her text's vocabulary and syntactic constructions. While doing this project, I have applied Logistic Regression algorithm to make the classification. The dataset is taken from 'https://pan.webis.de/clef17/pan17-web/author-profiling.html'.
